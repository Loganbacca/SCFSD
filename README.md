##What is it?

SCFSD is a fully-JavaScript tool for drawing all of the ships for your faction. Simply add the ship numbers, and it'll output for you. Simple as that.

##How do I use it?
[Go to this handy site](http://raylehnhoff.github.io/SCFSD/).

I tested it with modern versions of chrome/firefox.
